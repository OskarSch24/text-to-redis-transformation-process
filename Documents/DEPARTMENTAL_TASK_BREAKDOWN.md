## 📈 KEY STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES

### **Reusability Architecture**
```
Writer Agent Template → Copy-Paste → All Platforms
(Only change: system prompts + database queries)
```

### **60/40 Content Split**
```
60% AUTOMATED: Images, Text, Audio, Shorts
40% MANUAL: Mid-form (10-20min), Long-form (1-2hr)
```

### **Zero Hallucination Policy**
```
ALL CONTENT = YOUR DATABASE ONLY
No AI invention | Pure personal experience
```

### **50% Automation Threshold**
```
AI capability ≥50% → AUTOMATE
AI capability <50% → HUMAN-IN-LOOP
```
