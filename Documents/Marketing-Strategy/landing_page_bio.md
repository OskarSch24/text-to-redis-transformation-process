# PROFESSIONAL BIO (LANDING PAGE)

I became obsessed with Performance Communication after watching brilliant people destroy their own success by communicating poorly. After years in the trenches, closing deals worth millions and training hundreds of salespeople, I discovered that the difference between those who thrive and those who barely survive isn't talent or luck. It's the ability to enter someone else's world, ask the questions no one dares to ask, and guide them to decisions they're grateful for.

Today, I run AMQ, where we're rewriting the rules on what sales should be. No sleazy scripts. No Wall Street shark tactics. Just ancient rhetoric combined with cutting-edge AI automation—creating trust-loaded conversations that transform businesses. My community members don't just close deals; they build lasting skills that grow over time. We've removed the "salesman" stereotype and replaced it with real professionals who lead with empathy and precision.

I believe sales is the greatest skill in the world when you reframe it correctly. It's not about manipulation—it's about becoming a trusted advisor who gives someone decades of experience in their critical moment. Whether you're ready to 10x your close rate or finally build communication skills that last, one question remains: *Are you asking the right questions?*

## COPYWRITING TECHNIQUES USED:

1. **Pattern Interrupt Hook**: Opens with unexpected vulnerability ("I didn't love sales") to break preconceptions and create curiosity.

2. **Problem-Agitate-Solution**: Identifies relatable pain (brilliant people failing), intensifies it (survive vs. thrive), then positions unique solution.

3. **Concrete Specificity**: Uses tangible details ("millions," "hundreds of salespeople") over vague claims to build credibility.

4. **Transformation Focus**: Emphasizes outcomes and benefits ("transform businesses," "lasting skills") rather than features.

5. **Authority Stacking**: Weaves credentials naturally through story rather than listing them resume-style.

6. **Differentiation Through Negation**: "No sleazy scripts. No Wall Street shark tactics" immediately separates from competition.

7. **Metaphorical Language**: "Enter someone else's world" creates memorable, visual understanding of the approach.

8. **Future Pacing**: Helps reader imagine their improved state ("10x your close rate") to create desire.

9. **Open Loop CTA**: Ends with question that naturally leads to engagement while echoing the brand's core philosophy.
