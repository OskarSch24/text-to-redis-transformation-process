# Introduction

## Purpose of this Brand Brief

The Brand Brief is the single source of truth that translates our mission—"create a community of like-minded, high-aspiration people who master sales as a sustainable skill"—into clear, actionable guidance for every human and AI system working on the brand.

### Why this document exists

This document exists for four core reasons:

- Unify direction - It aligns founders, team-mates, partners, and autonomous agents around a shared definition of who we serve and why our work matters
- Operationalise Performance Communication - By codifying that "performance communication is sales", it ensures every touch-point—from discovery call to product UX—helps prospects decide with confidence
- Speed up creation - Ready-made building blocks (tone rules, one-liners, pain points) let contributors produce on-brand copy, code, or strategy in minutes instead of hours
- Guarantee consistency at scale - Key phrases and principles are stored as atomic, tagged memories, so AI agents retrieve and reuse them verbatim—keeping our voice Commanding, Empathetic, Pragmatic across every channel

When this brief is referenced correctly, anyone—or any bot—can ship work that feels unmistakably "us," faster and with zero drift.

This document is a synthesized form of my brand brief and business philosophy.

## Who will use it and how?

This document is used by AI agents within the n8n ecosystem who use the content of this document as context for the creation of social media, marketing and product creation content.

### Usage methodology

The AI agents will reference specific sections for context-appropriate content creation, maintain brand voice consistency across all touchpoints, apply principles and guidelines to ensure on-brand output, and leverage tagged memories for precise phrase and concept retrieval.

## Where will the information be stored?

The information from this document will be distributed across two primary systems:

### ZepAI Memory Software

Purpose: Rather dynamic data storage for frequently updated brand guidelines, current campaigns, evolving strategies. Integration: Native n8n workflows.

### Supabase Database

Purpose: Static data storage for core brand principles, permanent guidelines, foundational content. Integration: Native n8n workflows.

Both storage systems will be placed in the n8n native workflows to ensure seamless access and consistent application across all brand activities.
